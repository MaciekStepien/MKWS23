## About

This repository contains a computational study of detonation phenomena focusing on Chapman-Jouget detonation waves in methane-air and hydrogen-air mixtures. The project utilizes numerical simulations and combustion modeling techniques to analyze critical detonation parameters, flame propagation, and shock wave interactions relevant to combustion science and propulsion engineering.
